### TODO

* According to HW text:
```text
The users’ classes potentially differ for the demand curves of the 5 products, number of daily users, 𝛼 ratios, number of products sold, and graph probabilities. That is, for every random variable, you need to provide three different distributions, each one corresponding to a different users’ class.
```
We don't have alpha and probabilities change per user class.

Implement this.

* In step 4, uncertain alpha ratio, what does it mean?
* In step 5, uncertain graph probabilities, what does it mean?
* In step 6, sliding-window (passive)
* In step 6, change detection algorithm (active)
* What is the basis for step 6?
