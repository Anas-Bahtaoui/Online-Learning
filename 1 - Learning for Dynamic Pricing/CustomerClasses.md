# Professional
Athletes that train every day, are looking for higher quality products, products suitable for intensive training and look to achieve the higher results possible when training. 

This client will have in general higher demands for P5, P1 and P2; and the lowest demand for P3:

* **P1 and P2**: Their demand is mostly 0 for the lower prices (3/5) and it increases as the price increases.
* **P3**: The demand is still mostly 0 for the lower price (5) it increases as the price increases; however as it is not a product that directly influences performance and training it will peak around the higher middle prices (35) and slightly decrease as we reach the top price.
* **P4**: As professionals we can assume that they mostly train in an already equipped gym/facility, so they won't be very interested in investing too much in dumbbells to have at home; however should they have some interest in this product their demand will be concentrated around the middle prices (34 - 70) because they will still want to have high quality products and heavier weights, that are more expensive.
* **P5**: Their demand curve will be close to 0 for the lower prices (15 - 18) will start increasing as the prices increase and peak for the higher prices (35 - 60).

# Beginner under 35
This is a young costumer that is interested in improving it's shape so it is willing to invest some money to get some results. But as a young person is limited by a reasonable budget.

This client will have higher demand for P1 and P2 and then P4 then P5 and lastly P3. And in general this client has more interest in the products then the beginner over 35.

* **P1 and P2**: Their demand will be more concentrated around the lower middle prices (3/5 - 12/13) and start slighly decreasing as we reach the middle prices (20/22) and haver a more noticeable decrease as we get to the higher prices (40/35 - 80/85)
* **P3**: Their demand will be more concentrated in the lower price (2) and decrease as the prices increase
* **P4**: Their demand will increase as we go from the lower price (5) and be more concentrated around the middle prices (16 - 34) and decrease as the price increases; the demand is still higher for the lowest price (5) than for the higher ones (70 - 100). This happens because this costumer has a commitment to train and get results but as they are beginners the weighs will be lighter and so cheaper and as said before this costumer is the one with higher budget restrictions.
* **P5**: Their demand curve will be concentrated around the lower middle prices (18) and decrease as the price increases (35 - 60), the decrease in the demand is more significant as we reach the middle high prices

# Beginner over 35
This is a costumer that is older and so it trains more to keep active than to have very noticeable results. However, they have less budget restrictions wich makes them interested in middle to high quality products

* **P1 and P2**: Their demand curve will be concentrated around the middle prices (20/22); it will be low for the lowest prices (3/5) and will slowly increase as the price increases towards the lower middle prices (12/13) then the increase in demand will be more significant as we reach the middle prices (20/22) and then start slighly decrease as we get to the higher prices (40/35) and have a more significant decrease for the highest prices (80/85); however the demand for the highest price and the lowest price should be about the same.
* **P3**: The demand should peak around the middle price (15); the demand should be very low both for the lowest price (2) and the highest price (35). It should increase as the price increases from the lowest to the midle and decrease as e pass the middle price.
* **P4**: This client doesn't have a big commitment to training so their demand will be very concentrated around the lower prices  (5) and then decrease as the price increases, the decrease can be less accentuated until we reach the 2nd price (16) and then be more accentuated as the price increases.
* **P5**: For this type of product the demand is very small so its peak is around the lowest price (15)
